/**
 * Running `wp backwpup …` when the **command itself is what is under test**.
 *
 * This is the deliberate opposite of `support/backups.ts`, which runs some of the same commands as
 * *instrumentation* and throws on a non-zero exit — there, a failing command means the scenario's
 * arrangement broke. Here a non-zero exit is an observation to assert: half the surface's contract
 * is how it refuses (a missing archive, an unknown field, a second job while one is running). One
 * module cannot hold both stances without every caller passing a "do I throw?" flag, so the two
 * live side by side and this one never throws for an outcome. It still throws when the command
 * could not be run at all — that distinction is `common/wp/exec.ts`'s and is inherited unchanged.
 *
 * Assertions read {@link CliResult.notices} rather than hunting substrings in raw output: WP-CLI
 * prefixes its own status lines with `Success:` / `Warning:` / `Error:`, and all 17 commands speak
 * it, so matching it structurally keeps a reworded sentence a visible mismatch instead of a
 * silently passing `.includes()`.

 * practice WP-CLI puts `Success:` on stdout and `Warning:`/`Error:` on stderr, so a level is
 * usually enough to find a line without caring where it came from.
 *
 * **A notice can span lines, so the two streams are read differently.** WP-CLI writes each notice
 * whole, and its own refusals do span lines — `Parameter errors:`, then one line per parameter it
 * rejected, sometimes a `Did you mean …?` after that — so on stderr, which carries little else, a
 * line that is not a status line continues the one above it, joined with a newline. Stdout is read
 * line by line: the command's own output shares it, and a continuation there cannot be told apart
 * from whatever the command printed next. BackWPup's own notices are all single-line, so this only
 * ever changes what WP-CLI's refusals read as.
