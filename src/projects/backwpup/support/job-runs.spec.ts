/**
 * The running-job reader, the two waits built on it, and the teardown's stop — driven over the real
 * exec layer by a stub `wp` that plays back a script of run states.
 *
 * There is one script per number of stops the site has been sent, because being told to stop is the
 * one thing that changes what a real site reports: script 0 is what `eval` answers until the first
 * `backwpup kill`, script 1 what it answers after it, and so on — the highest script written answers
 * for every stop after it. Each answer is one line, the last line repeats (which is how a state that
 * never changes is written), and a line reading `!fail` makes that `eval` fail the way a site that
 * cannot be reached for a moment does. A stop request is dropped — never reaching the site — while
 * `kill-drops` holds a number above zero. Every call is recorded, so a case can count the questions
 * and the stop requests it cost.
