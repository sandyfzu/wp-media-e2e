 *              (`reporting/retention.ts`); `npm run report:prune` prunes every cell.
 *  - output / auth / bdd → EPHEMERAL, stable per (product, cell); overwritten in place
 *              each run, so they never accumulate.
 *
 * The `*_ROOT` env vars and `RUN_ID` are the only knobs (an orchestrator may pin RUN_ID
 * so every cell of a batch shares one token). The `<product>/<cell>` namespace is always
 * appended, so two cells never share a directory, and a run that targets no single cell
 * writes its output under {@link NO_CELL} instead ({@link outputDirFor}). A run is held to one
 * cell by `E2E_CELL` (see `cell-pin.ts`), or selects it with `--project`.
