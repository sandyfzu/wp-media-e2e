 * The device profiles scenarios run under, and the tag that selects a non-default one.

 * Device is a **per-scenario client** concern, orthogonal to cells and editions: it never
 * multiplies the project matrix and never touches the worker→site binding. So there is one
 * default — desktop, applied by the config factory to every project — and a tag that swaps in
 * a mobile profile for the scenarios that need it, applied through `use` overrides at context
 * creation (see `../fixtures.ts`).
 *
 * Both profiles are a Playwright `devices[…]` preset with the viewport pinned to the size the
 * suite standardises on. Taking the preset rather than a bare viewport is what makes a mobile
 * scenario genuinely mobile — `isMobile`, `hasTouch`, a mobile `userAgent` and the right
 * `deviceScaleFactor` all come with it, so responsive CSS, touch handlers and any server-side
 * `wp_is_mobile()` branch behave as they do for a real visitor. Pinning the viewport keeps
 * viewport-sensitive expectations (above-the-fold image sets, LCP candidates) stable even if a
 * Playwright upgrade changes a preset's default size.
