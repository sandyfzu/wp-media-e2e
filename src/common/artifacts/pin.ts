/**
 * What a build actually built, in a form a later run can ask for again. A ref like `develop` moves
 * between a warm and the run it was for, so the orchestrator hands the run the **pin** this module
 * derives — a ref (`commit:<sha>` or `release:<tag>`) and, for a commit, the version that was built —
 * which plans to the same APVM cache entry.
 *
 * Measured offline on apvm-napi 3.0.0: a commit pin given its built version is served from the cache
 * with no network (APVM's commit check against GitHub fails and is tolerated); without the version,
 * an embedded-version product (WP Rocket) fetches its version file first, and clones when it cannot.
 * A release pin always asks GitHub's API for the release, so it needs network — but names one tag.
 *
 * Pure: it reads only the fields APVM returns, so it is unit-testable without the native binding.
