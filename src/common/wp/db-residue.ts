/**
 * The data a plugin leaves in a site's **database** once its files are gone — and removing it so the
 * next install is genuinely fresh.
 *
 * The filesystem counterpart in `residue.ts` exists because a plugin's uninstall deliberately
 * keeps the files it wrote. This one exists for the opposite reason: a well-behaved plugin's
 * uninstall *does* clear its database footprint, but that cleanup lives in the plugin's own
 * `uninstall.php` — so it only ever runs while the plugin's **files are still there**.
 *
 * That is the whole gap. `ensurePluginAbsent` can only ask WordPress to uninstall a plugin whose files
 * are there, so a site whose plugin directory has gone while its rows remain has nothing to run.
 * Measured on a real cell: `wp plugin uninstall <slug> --deactivate` — the one call this suite
 * forbids, precisely because the plugin's own guard then skips its cleanup — deletes the files and
 * leaves **26 options and the plugin's table** behind. The next run installs on top of that, the
 * plugin reads its own leftover version, concludes it is an upgrade rather than a first install, and
 * the scenario fails somewhere that blames the product.
 *
 * So this sweep keys off the **footprint**, never off the plugin being installed. A product declares
 * what its footprint looks like and the shared scenario hooks clear it whenever they find it.
 *
 * Roles count too, for a subtler reason: WordPress's `add_role()` returns without a change when the
 * role already exists, so a plugin's "add/overwrite roles" activation keeps whatever capabilities a
 * leftover role carries. Measured on a cell: a stale `backwpup_check` survived a fresh install with
 * the capabilities planted in it, not the ones the artifact defines — the scenario would test a role
 * the product never defines.
 *
 * **It only makes sense with the plugin absent, and the hooks guarantee that by ordering.** Measured
 * on a cell: sweeping while the plugin is active does work, and the very next WordPress request puts
 * all 26 options and the table straight back — the plugin re-creates its own footprint on `init`.
 * Both callers therefore run it immediately after `ensurePluginAbsent`, which throws rather than
 * return with anything still at the plugin's path — and which, when the plugin's own uninstall
 * fails, removes its folder without it, leaving exactly the rows this takes.
 */

/**
 * What a product leaves in a site's database, as the product declares it.

 * installed before, the table its installer tries to create again, and the roles and capabilities
 * activation does not overwrite (`add_role()` keeps an existing role as it is). User meta is left
 * out: a plugin's notices re-create it, nothing reads it to decide what to install, and the next real

/**
 * Removes the declared footprint from a site, and confirms it is gone.
 *
 * Rows go through `delete_option` rather than a `DELETE`, so WordPress invalidates its own caches as
 * it would for any other deletion — which is why no cache flush follows. Tables are dropped with
 * `IF EXISTS`, so a table that vanished between the scan and the drop is not an error. Roles and
 * capabilities go through the role API, which does the same for the roles option.
 *
 * Removal is **verified by re-reading**, in a second process, straight from the database rather than
 * from any cache — the same discipline the rest of this layer applies to WP-CLI's exit codes. A
 * `DROP` reports success for a table it never had to touch, and `delete_option` returns false both
 * for "there was nothing there" and for "a filter refused it".
 *
 * @param transport - the site to clean.
 * @param residue - the product's declaration. Declaring nothing does nothing at all.
 * @returns what was removed, so a caller can say what it found rather than that it ran.
 * @throws {@link Error} if a declared entry is unusable, if a matched option belongs to WordPress
 * itself (nothing is removed), if the site is multisite or keeps its roles where they cannot be
 * read, or if WordPress could not answer; or {@link SiteDbResidueRemovalFailedError} naming
 * whatever survived the removal.
