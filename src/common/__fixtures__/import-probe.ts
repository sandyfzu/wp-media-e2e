/**
 * For specs: what importing a module does to the process-wide state a long-lived process (the
 * orchestrator) keeps for its whole life — its environment variables, its listeners on process
 * events (one `SIGINT` listener is enough to turn off Node's exit on Ctrl-C), its working directory,
 * its exit code, its umask (every file it creates), its listener limits, `Error.stackTraceLimit`, and
 * the functions a module could wrap to watch or steer it: `fetch` (Slack's webhook and Datator's key
 * pass through it), `process.exit`, `process.cwd`, `process.chdir`, `fs.close` and `fs.closeSync`.
 * Output written and other globals set are not compared; nor is anything a module starts later than
 * its import, from a function or an unref'd timer.
 *
 * One change is accepted, by name ({@link GRACEFUL_FS_PATCH}): graceful-fs's. Playwright bundles it
 * (`playwright-core`'s `utilsBundle.js`, and again in `playwright`'s `expect.js`), and the product
 * list reaches Playwright through the products' support modules, so importing `products.ts` wraps
 * `fs.close`, `fs.closeSync`, `process.cwd` and `process.chdir` — measured with Playwright 1.63. The
 * wrappers keep what they wrap (a close retries graceful-fs's queued opens; `cwd` is cached and
 * `chdir` clears the cache), and avoiding them would mean a product list that never loads its
 * products' support code. It is recognised by its marks, not by name: all four at once, each close
 * wrapping the one before through graceful-fs's `previous` symbol, `chdir` the old one through its
 * prototype chain, and `cwd` still answering the same folder. Any other wrapper is reported.
