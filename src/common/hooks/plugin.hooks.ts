/**
 * Product-agnostic scenario hooks for the plugin under test, scoped to `@plugin`.
 *
 * A tagged scenario gets the cell's own edition installed and activated beforehand, a `debug.log`
 * scoped to just that scenario, a failure if PHP logged a fatal, and a clean site afterwards —
 * clean including the **files** the plugin wrote, which its own uninstall keeps. Work the plugin is
 * still doing is stopped before each removal: before the install, work a killed run left behind;
 * afterwards, the scenario's own. A scenario the drain skipped (`config/drain.ts`) is left alone.
 * Neither the edition nor the product is named here: the slug comes from the resolved artifact and
 * the product policy from the product's own config, so one hook pair serves `backwpup`,
 * `backwpup-pro` and `wp-rocket` alike.
 *
 * **This file must be listed in every product's `steps` globs.** A hook file outside them is
 * never imported, so its hooks register silently and the lifecycle simply never runs — the
 * failure mode is a scenario that finds no plugin, not an error.
 *
 * The policy itself lives in `./plugin-lifecycle.ts`; this file only binds it to the runtime.
